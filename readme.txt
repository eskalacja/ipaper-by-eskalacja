=== iPaper by Eskalacja.com ===
When telesphore discontinued iPaper development, we decided to take over this project. We had no choice, since one of our client use the plugin and won't change it to another one.

=== What we actually do ===
We just provide patches to make the plugin compatible with latest Wordpress.

=== How to contribute ===
You can join to our github repository. Any pull request is welcomed.

=== Who we are ===
We are eskalacja.com. We build and maintain websites and webapps for our clients. We also encourage you to check out our website monitoring tool (uptime monitoring, content monitoring) at agentslug.com
